<div class="column-66">
  <h3 class="large-font"><b>1.Usability</b></h3>
  <h6>The design of your website has a significant influence on how simple it is for visitors to locate what they're searching for. According to research, 86 percent of your website visitors want to view product or service information, 65 percent want contact information, and 52 percent want to see your company's About page.</h6>
  <h6>You should make these items as easy to locate as possible in your site design; otherwise, you'll frustrate and maybe drive away your consumers. Consider the following industry best practices, such as putting your core services in the main menu and displaying your phone number in the upper-right corner of your website.</h6>
  <h6>Even if your website performs flawlessly, a poor design may give consumers the impression that it is more difficult to use or obtain what they want. This was the subject of a study undertaken by two Japanese academics. They constructed two identical ATMs, one of which was aesthetically designed and the other was not. Users said that the more aesthetically beautiful ATM was really more functional. As a result, effective web design has an impact on usability as well as our impression of usability.</h6>

  <h3 class="large-font"><b>2.Navigation</b></h3>
      
  <h6>Because your navigation is one of the most significant aspects of your website design, it's crucial that it's well-designed. Many designers use Hick's Law to take into account the psychology underlying the design.</h6>
  <h6>The more options you provide someone, the longer it takes them to make a decision, according to Hick's Law. "Keep things simple, stupid," as the saying goes.</h6>
  <h6>When using Hick's Law to navigate a website, we want to keep the options as basic as possible to make it easy for consumers to pick where to go. Try to keep the number of alternatives to seven or less as a general guideline.</h6>
  <h6>Take, for example, this firm that sells office furniture. There are 11 distinct alternatives on their product menu, which is a lot of variety. If you look closely, you'll see that there are other comparable categories, such as "conference chairs," "task chairs," "guest chairs," and "other seats." They might make navigating easier by consolidating all of those categories into a single "Chairs" choice.</h6>

  h3 class="large-font"><b>3.Conversion</b></h3>
    
  <h6>Good site design directs your visitors' gaze and tells them where they should look. Your website's design may assist consumers to recognize buttons and clickable components, bring attention to unique deals and emphasize calls to action. All of these factors can influence users to do the behaviors they desire.</h6>
  <h6>There are several methods for optimizing your visual design for conversion, but let's look at a number of typical examples.</h6>
  <h6>Using white space - or free space - surrounding your call to action is one of the most effective methods to capture visitors' attention to the desired action.</h6>
  <h6>It's difficult to discuss white space without bringing up Apple. Clean designs and simple, strong pictures (like this iPhone) surrounded by a lot of white space are what they're renowned for. The message is clear: they want you to click on this phone, and with so little else on the page to keep you from doing so, it's virtually impossible not to.</h6>
  <h6>Consider a site like Amazon on the other end of the spectrum. Although there is a lot of information and product selections on this page, one thing stands out: the yellow Add to Cart button. Contrasting colours and styles create a visual hierarchy that pulls your attention to the conversion button, even on a busy page.</h6>

  h3 class="large-font"><b>4.Mobile Friendliness</b></h3>
  
  <h6>Mobile devices currently account for the bulk of internet searches, and this trend is only expected to grow. With Google now promoting a mobile-first strategy, having a mobile-friendly website design is a must if you want to stay current and be found online. In fact, 85% of individuals believe that a company's mobile website design should be on par with or better than its desktop website design.<h6>
  <h6>Web designers are typically preoccupied with making a website seem ideal on a desktop as if it were a brochure. An excellent website design, on the other hand, must expand beyond a single screen. In today's mobile-friendly environment, you'll need a responsive website design to ensure that your site looks and functions well on all devices.</h6>
